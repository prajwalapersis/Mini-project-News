                      <p class="summary">The BJP-led NDA and the Opposition INDIA alliance are set for another round of fight, especially in Maharashtra and Haryana. The Election Commission is yet to declare the dates for the Rajya Sabha polls for these 10 seats. Out of the vacant seats, two are each in Assam, Bihar and Maharashtra. The BJP is likely to face a stiff challenge in the polls for the vacant seats in Maharashtra and Haryana. While the BJP has 41 members, the Congress has 29 after its Mullana MLA Varun Chaudhary got elected to the Lok Sabha from Ambala. The Dushyant Chautala-led JJP has 10 MLAs, while there are five Independent legislators. The remaining 44 MLAs appear to be in the Opposition camp, at least on paper, which include 29 of the Congress and 10 of the JJP. The Congress is hopeful that if it gets the support of all the Opposition MLAs, it can defeat the BJP in Haryana, which however looks unlikely. The BJP is seeking to become the largest party in the state of Haryana. The party has been in power since the 1980s. It is the first time the state has been able to elect a majority of its own MPs. The current Congress is the third largest party after the BJP and the Congress Party. The Shiv Sena, which won seven Lok Sabha seats, is unhappy because other NDA allies with fewer seats got the Cabinet berths. The NCP was offered a Minister of State (MoS) post, which did not accept it as the party wanted a Cabinet position. The BJP will comfortably bag the Upper House seat in Rajasthan.</p>
