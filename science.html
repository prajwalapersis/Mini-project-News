              <p class="summary">"The Starliner will return to Earth on June 26. The decision comes as Nasa and Boeing continue to investigate issues encountered during the spacecraft's inaugural crewed mission. The spacecraft experienced four helium leaks and five failures of its 28 maneuvering thrusters during the 24-hour flight. Nasa is targeting a departure no earlier than June 26, leaving open the possibility for further extensions if necessary. The return to Earth is expected to last approximately six hours, with a targeted landing in the desert regions of Utah, New Mexico. Once certified, Starliner will join SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the second U.S. crew vehicle in Nasa's fleet. A failed uncrewed test in 2019 due to software glitches, design problems, and management issues that prevented docking with the ISS. A successful uncrewing test was conducted in 2022. The ISS is expected to be fully operational by 2024."</p>

              <h2 class="headline">NASA warns that a giant asteroid of the size of 'Eiffel Tower' is set to pass "alarmingly close" to Earth on this date</h2>
              <p class="summary">Asteroid 99942 Apophis is on course to pass by Earth on April 13, 2029. The celestial body, named after the Egyptian god of chaos, has garnered significant attention due to its impressive size and proximity to our planet. The asteroid is supposedly larger than the famous Eiffel tower. Apophis will approach Earth at a distance of approximately 20,000 -30,000 miles. The asteroid is moving at a speed of 29.98 km per second. The data collected could provide valuable information on the composition and structure of these space rocks. The 2029 flyby of Apophis will be a historic moment for both professional and amateur astronomers. The asteroid will be visible to the naked eye in certain parts of the globe. The event is expected to foster a greater interest in astronomy and the study of near-Earth objects (NEOs) For more information on this and other NEOs, please refer to official NASA communications and publications.
