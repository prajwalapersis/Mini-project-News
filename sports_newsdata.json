        "text": "Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran set the stage for Afghanistan's remarkable 21-run victory over Australia with a solid 118-run opening partnership in St Vincent on Saturday, keeping their hopes of reaching the T20 World Cup semi-finals alive. Australia, the 2021 champions, could have secured their place in the semi-finals along with India with a win, but even Pat Cummins' second consecutive hat-trick couldn\u2019t preserve their unbeaten record in the tournament. Afghanistan's Naveen-ul-Haq bowls against Papua New Guinea during an ICC Men's T20 World Cup cricket match at Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Tarouba(PTI)\n\nHalf-centuries from Gurbaz and Zadran powered Afghanistan to a competitive total of 148-6 on a challenging Kingstown pitch. Afghanistan's bowlers then delivered a stellar performance, dismissing Australia for 127. Gulbadin Naib was the standout bowler with impressive figures of 4-20, while Naveen-ul-Haq contributed significantly with 3-20.\n\nNow catch your favourite game on Crickit. Anytime Anywhere. Find out how\n\nThe win not only kept Afghanistan\u2019s semi-final hopes alive but also ensured that Bangladesh, too, remain in contention.\n\nNaveen, the star pacer, played a pivotal role in Afghanistan's triumph, taking three crucial wickets, including that of Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh. His performance was instrumental in restricting Australia to 127.\n\nFollowing the match, Naveen took to Instagram, posting a cryptic message that hinted at his disappointment with the criticism the team has faced in the past. His post subtly addressed the doubters, reflecting the team's resolve and determination to prove their critics wrong. Interestingly, India's leading pacer, Jasprit Bumrah, had also posted the same picture earlier this year in February as one of his Instagram stories after his brilliant performance in the second Test against England earned India a strong win.\n\nSee the post here:\n\n\"I can sleep better now, I think,\" Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan told the reporters after the historic win. \"That game kept coming in my mind ... Maxi, the way he played that night, took the game away from us and I didn't sleep the whole night.\n\n\"Tonight, because of the happiness I won't be able to sleep. That's how happy the whole team is and the whole country is. It's a massive win for us, as a team, as a nation.\n\n\"Cricket is the only source of happiness back home, we all know that. And I feel like we are so lucky to be here giving happiness to the people back home.\"",

        "text": "West Indies were left shell shocked and the home side's fans were silenced at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Sunday. The way South Africa clinched their three-wicket victory didn't justify how the game went on in the run chase. The West Indies dugout react to Marco Jansen's match-winning six.\n\nIt was a tough run chase for Aiden Markram and Co. and initially they were set a target of 136 runs and reached 15/2 in two overs, and West Indies looked like they were going to destroy the opposition's batting order.\n\nNow catch your favourite game on Crickit. Anytime Anywhere. Find out how\n\nBut rain happened after two overs and on resumption, the run chase was cut to 17 overs, with a revised DLS target of 123 runs. It looked easy initially, but West Indies stayed in the game and narrowed down the equation to five runs needed off six balls. In stepped Obed McCoy, and everyone expected to keep it tight for Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada, the way they had done until then.\n\nUntil the final over of the revised run chase, Jansen had only registered 15 runs off 13 balls and didn't look like he was in good batting touch. But the all-rounder had other plans and suddenly woke up in the final over!\n\nReceiving a slot delivery just outside off, Jansen planted his front foot and clobbered through the line, sending it over the long-on boundary for a match-winning six! It did not clear the boundary by much, but it was enough and it sent the South African dugout into a moment of pure ecstacy and elation, as they jumped up and down. Meanwhile, the co-hosts were left stunned and so were their fans, who expected it to be a victory. Their dugout was the perfect reflection as the coaching staff held their heads in disappointment.\n\nHere is the video:\n\nThe match began with Markram winning the toss and opting to bowl. West Indies reached 135/8 in 20 overs, courtesy of Roston Chase's (52) half-century. Meanwhile, Tabraiz Shamsi struck thrice for South Africa.\n\nChasing the revised target of 123 runs, South Africa reached 124/7 in 16.1 overs as Jansen (21*) remained unbeaten. For the West Indies' bowling department, Chase took three wickets. The win also sent South Africa to the semi-finals.",
